# Jay-GPT 
Created a full-stack web application using the MERN Stack. This is an AI Chatbot application, inspired by ChatGPT and called Jay-GPT, by using MERN Stack and OpenAI. It's a customized chatbot where each message of the user is stored in DB and can be retrieved and deleted. It's a completely secure application using JWT Tokens, HTTP-Only Cookies, Signed Cookies, Password Encryption, and Middleware Chains. Done with help from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKqU7lmR4wQ5Bj9F9E9i_Q
